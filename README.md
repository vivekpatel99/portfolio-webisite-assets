# Vivek Patel Portfolio

This is the source for [www.vivekapatel.com](https://www.vivekapatel.com): a React 18 + Vite portfolio site with a Convex-backed contact form. The frontend is a section-based portfolio and project/case-study experience; the backend currently stores anonymous contact leads and sends email notifications through Resend.

The repository is also wired for Hostinger Horizons, so some Vite plugins and browser `postMessage` handlers are platform integration code rather than ordinary app code. Treat those pieces carefully.

## Quick Start

Use Node `24` from `.nvmrc`.

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_CONVEX_URL` in `.env.local` when you want the contact form to talk to Convex. For UI-only local work, the app can start without it, but contact submissions will fail with a clear disabled-client message.

## Core Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite on port `3000`. |
| `npm run build` | Generate `public/sitemap.xml`, build with Vite, then generate static route HTML under `dist/`. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build on port `3000`. |
| `npm test` | Run Vitest unit tests, including Convex tests through `convex-test`. |
| `npm run qa:seo` | Check route SEO metadata for preview and production targets. |
| `npm run qa:playwright:passive` | Run passive Playwright QA across configured preview and production projects. |
| `npm run qa:playwright:ci` | Run the preview desktop/mobile Playwright subset used by CI. |
| `npm run qa:playwright:live-contact` | Opt-in live contact-form QA. This can create real Convex leads and send email. |
| `npm run convex:dev` | Start Convex local/dev workflow. |
| `npm run convex:smoke` | Submit a marked smoke-test lead to `VITE_CONVEX_URL`. This can trigger email if Resend is configured. |

There is no lint script currently, even though ESLint packages are installed.

## Application Shape

The app boots from `index.html` into `src/main.jsx`, which mounts React into `#root` and wraps the app with:

- `ConvexProvider` from `convex/react`
- `BrowserRouter`
- `ScrollToTop`
- `App`

Routes are centralized in `src/App.jsx` and animated with Framer Motion:

| Route | Component | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `src/pages/Home.jsx` | Main section-based portfolio page. |
| `/contact` | `src/pages/Contact.jsx` | Contact form backed by Convex. |
| `/project/:projectId` | `src/pages/Project.jsx` | Case-study route rendered from the validated publication projection. |
| `/legal` | `src/pages/Legal.jsx` | Privacy/legal content. |
| `/data-policy` | `src/pages/DataPolicy.jsx` | Cookie/data policy content. |
| `*` | redirect to `/` | SPA fallback inside React Router. |

`src/components/Layout.jsx` is the shared shell around all routes. It owns the skip link, custom cursor, consent-gated Google Analytics and Sentry, header, footer, toaster, and cookie consent banner.

## Frontend Map

The home page is composed in `src/pages/Home.jsx`:

- `Hero`
- `TechStack`
- `Services`
- `About`
- `Experience`
- `Portfolio`
- `Testimonials`
- `Connect`
- `CTA`

Most sections are wrapped in `SectionAnimator` for scroll-triggered Framer Motion animation.

Important frontend files:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `src/components/Header.jsx` | Fixed desktop/mobile navigation, hash navigation, contact CTA. |
| `src/components/Footer.jsx` | Footer links, cookie manager trigger, contact/social links. |
| `src/components/Services.jsx` | Local accordion state for service copy. |
| `src/components/Portfolio.jsx` | Published case-study cards, optional covers, summaries, and article links. |
| `src/components/Experience.jsx` | Timeline/collapsible experience section. |
| `src/pages/Contact.jsx` | Contact form state, client-side validation, Convex mutation call, toasts, Sentry capture. |
| `src/pages/Project.jsx` | Case-study route lookup, SEO, article rendering, and missing-project handling. |
| `src/config/links.js` | Centralized social links, remote image URLs, logos, backgrounds, tech icons, gallery images. |
| `src/lib/seoConfig.js` | Site URL, default SEO, route-specific SEO config. |
| `src/lib/seo.js` | React Helmet SEO component. |
| `src/lib/consent.js` | Cookie consent persistence helpers. |
| `src/lib/sentryTelemetry.js` | Production-only Sentry init and capture helpers. |
| `src/lib/convexClient.js` | Convex URL validation and client creation. |

There are a few legacy or currently-unused frontend files, including `src/pages/CookiePolicy.jsx`, `src/pages/PrivacyPolicy.jsx`, `src/components/WelcomeMessage.jsx`, `src/components/CallToAction.jsx`, and `src/components/ErrorButton.jsx`.

## Styling And UI

Styling is Tailwind-first:

- `src/index.css` defines base CSS variables, dark theme defaults, scroll offsets, custom cursor behavior, reduced-motion behavior, scrollbar helpers, and text-gradient utilities.
- `tailwind.config.js` extends theme tokens, including `accent.purple` (`#9372FF`), CSS-variable colors, border radii, and accordion animations.
- `postcss.config.js` wires Tailwind and Autoprefixer.

Reusable UI primitives live in `src/components/ui/`. They are shadcn-style local wrappers around Radix UI, CVA, and Tailwind utilities. Use these first for buttons, inputs, textarea, select, checkbox, collapsible, toast, and toaster behavior.

`src/lib/utils.js` exposes the `cn()` helper for `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`.

## Convex Backend

Before changing Convex code, read:

```text
convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md
```

That file contains project-local Convex rules that override generic assumptions. The main reminders are: validate all function args, use indexes instead of filters, keep public functions non-sensitive, derive auth server-side if auth is ever added, and avoid unbounded `.collect()` patterns.

Current backend shape:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `convex/schema.ts` | Defines the single `leads` table and indexes. |
| `convex/leads.ts` | Public lead submission mutation, internal email status mutation, internal Resend email action, email helpers. |
| `convex/lib/leadValidation.ts` | Shared lead validation and normalization. |
| `convex/migrations/importLeads.ts` | Internal migration helper for historical lead rows. |
| `convex/leads.test.ts` | Convex lead and email-helper tests. |
| `convex/migrations/importLeads.test.ts` | Migration helper tests. |
| `tools/convex-smoke-test.mjs` | HTTP-client smoke test that submits a marked lead. |

### Lead Data Model

The `leads` table stores:

- `name`
- `email`
- optional `budget`
- `description`
- `createdAt`
- optional email notification status/error fields

Indexes:

- `by_createdAt`
- `by_email`
- `by_email_and_createdAt`

`by_email_and_createdAt` is used for the current per-email rate limit.

### Contact Submission Flow

1. `src/pages/Contact.jsx` calls `useMutation(api.leads.submitLead)`.
2. `convex/leads.ts` validates and normalizes the payload with `validateLeadInput`.
3. The mutation rate-limits to three submissions per normalized email per hour.
4. The mutation inserts the lead with `emailNotificationStatus: "pending"`.
5. It schedules `internal.leads.sendContactEmail`.
6. The internal action calls Resend if `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured.
7. The action writes back `sent`, `missing_api_key`, `resend_error`, or returns the row to `pending` so the cron can retry. `unexpected_error` exists in the schema but is not written.

There is no Convex auth configuration today. This is intentionally an anonymous insert-only contact form: public clients can submit leads, but there are no public read/update/delete functions.

Security caveats:

- Rate limiting is per email, not per IP/device.
- Parallel duplicate submissions are allowed by existing tests.
- XSS-like text is stored as plain text; keep React escaping intact if rendering leads anywhere in the future.

## Environment Variables

Frontend:

| Variable | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_CONVEX_URL` | `.env.local`, Hostinger build env, GitHub repo vars | Required for production. Expected shape: `https://<deployment>.convex.cloud`, including regional Convex hosts. |

Convex dashboard:

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Enables contact email notifications. Without it, leads are still saved and marked `missing_api_key`. |
| `CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | Notification recipient. Defaults in code if unset. |
| `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | Should be a verified-domain sender in production. Avoid Resend sandbox sender for production. |

QA:

| Variable | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `QA_PREVIEW_URL` | Preview base URL for Playwright. Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. |
| `QA_PROD_URL` | Production base URL for passive QA. Defaults to `https://www.vivekapatel.com`. |
| `QA_LIVE_CONTACT_BASE_URL` | Base URL for live contact submission tests. |
| `QA_LIVE_CONTACT_SUBMIT` | Must be `1` to include the live contact-submit project. |
| `QA_LIVE_CONTACT_EMAIL` | Sender email used by live contact QA. |

Sentry DSN and Google Analytics ID are currently hardcoded in `src/lib/sentryTelemetry.js` and `src/components/GoogleAnalytics.jsx`.

## SEO And Static Output

SEO is handled in several layers:

- Base meta tags and JSON-LD live in `index.html`.
- Runtime route tags are emitted by `src/lib/seo.js`.
- Route SEO data lives in `src/lib/seoConfig.js`.
- `tools/generate-sitemap.js` writes `public/sitemap.xml` for `https://www.vivekapatel.com`.
- `tools/generate-static-route-html.js` rewrites route-specific SEO tags into `dist/<route>/index.html` after the Vite build.

Do not replace `npm run build` with plain `vite build` in deploy or CI, because that skips sitemap and static route HTML generation.

## Testing And QA

Vitest:

- `vitest.config.ts` uses `edge-runtime` by default for Convex tests.
- `src/**/*.test.{jsx,tsx}` runs in `jsdom`.
- Playwright specs under `tests/qa/` are excluded from Vitest.

Important test coverage:

- `convex/leads.test.ts`: lead validation, inserts, optional budget, oversized fields, invalid email/budget, unicode, plain-text XSS-like payloads, rate limiting, duplicate parallel submits, Resend payload and error behavior.
- `convex/migrations/importLeads.test.ts`: historical lead import behavior.
- `src/pages/Contact.test.jsx`: mocked Convex mutation behavior for missing fields, invalid email, valid submit, and mutation failure.
- `src/lib/convexClient.test.js`: Convex URL validation and disabled-client behavior.
- `src/components/SentryTelemetry.test.jsx`: consent-gated Sentry behavior.

Playwright:

- Specs live in `tests/qa/`.
- Artifacts go to `playwright-output/`.
- Passive projects cover preview and production desktop/mobile.
- Live contact submission is opt-in only and can create real leads and email side effects.

Set `QA_LOCAL_ONLY=1` for CI-safe preview QA. It accepts only a loopback preview URL; browser routing aborts every non-loopback HTTP(S) request before transport, including subresources, `fetch` calls, beacons, and redirects originating from loopback. External CDN images are therefore omitted in local-only CI rather than requested. External WebSockets close with policy code `1008`, and service-worker registration is blocked because service-worker traffic bypasses Playwright request routes.

Those controls apply only to local-only projects. Manual passive production checks and the existing opt-in live-contact workflow keep their separate, explicit controls; the fake-Sentry check fulfills its `telemetry.invalid` requests in memory at page scope.

CI runs its preview-only suite with `QA_ARTIFACT_SAFE_MODE=1`. It reconstructs and retains only `qa-artifacts/summary.json` and `qa-artifacts/failure-results.json` for seven days. Those documents contain fixed suite/project labels, result-count enums, bounded source lines, test ordinals, one-based attempt/retry indices, and capped durations. The sanitizer rejects any other staged file before the upload action runs.

Native screenshots, videos, storage state, Playwright trace archives, raw JSON reports, raw logs, and `error-context.md` files are intentionally excluded from retention because they cannot be proved redacted. Safe mode disables Playwright's configured screenshot, trace, video, and storage-state capture; runner-created raw files can still exist in the job workspace but are never upload candidates. Run `npm run qa:artifacts:verify` to reconstruct and inspect the synthetic hostile failure fixture locally. The CI scope uses synthetic invalid/non-deliverable test data only: it does not submit a valid contact request, visit production, deploy, or retain valid contact data, credentials, secrets, environment files, or repository source.

See `docs/PRODUCTION_TEST_PLAN.md` before running production-impacting checks.

## Deployment

Production is hosted by Hostinger Horizons and built from GitHub `main`.

Expected deployment flow:

1. Open a branch.
2. Push and open a PR into `main`.
3. Let GitHub CI pass.
4. Merge to `main`.
5. Hostinger Horizons builds with `npm run build`.
6. Verify `/`, `/contact`, `/robots.txt`, and `/sitemap.xml` on the live domain.

CI in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

- Installs with `npm ci`.
- Validates `VITE_CONVEX_URL`.
- Runs `npm test`.
- Removes stale `dist`.
- Builds.
- Validates fresh build output.
- Checks that built files do not contain Supabase, local backend, or placeholder backend strings.
- Ensures `dist/` is not tracked.
- Installs Chromium.
- Runs SEO and passive Playwright QA against preview.

`dist/` is generated output and should not be committed.

## Hostinger Horizons Guardrails

This repository is synced with Hostinger Horizons. Be cautious around:

- `plugins/`
- the visual editor plugins in `vite.config.js`
- selection mode and iframe route restoration plugins
- injected Horizons error handlers
- `window.parent.postMessage()` integration patterns

`CLAUDE.md` has the strongest warning: do not modify or break Horizons-related code unless the task explicitly requires it and you understand the platform integration.

- `CLAUDE.md`: Claude/Horizons development constraints.
- `docs/deployment.md`: production deployment path and variables.
- `docs/PRODUCTION_TEST_PLAN.md`: passive and live production QA plan.
- `docs/convex-migration-notes.md`: Supabase-to-Convex migration notes.

## Generated And Ignored Artifacts

Common generated outputs:

- `dist/`
- `playwright-output/`
- `test-results/`
- Playwright reports
- Lighthouse cache
- `.env.local`
- Convex generated APIs under `convex/_generated/`

The root `.mcp.json` configures local tooling. Review it before sharing or publishing the repository because it may contain machine-specific or credential-like settings.

## Current Caveats

- The current app has one public Convex mutation and no authenticated backend area.
- Contact form abuse protection is minimal and email-based.
- Several docs in `docs/reviews/` describe past states; prefer current source files and current tests when they disagree.
- Some content is still hardcoded in component files rather than a CMS or data layer.
- Some image assets are remote URLs; visual regressions can come from upstream asset availability.
